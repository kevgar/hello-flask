# hello-flask
This is a demo of a simple flask app which plots a histogram of the waiting time between eruptions of the Old Faithful Geyser. The data is sourced from kaggle and can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/janithwanni/old-faithful).  

The app can be executed on your machine by running `app.py` in your local python then navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in a browser.
